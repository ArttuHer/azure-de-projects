## Questions

1. Deploy Azure Data Lake storage Gen 2 with Terraform
2. Deploy two Azure Databricks workspaces (prod/dev)
  - prod-databricks-ws
  - dev-databricks-ws 
  - resources: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/terraform/azure-workspace
  - terraform: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/databricks_workspace

3. Destroy resources to avoid any costs


## folder structure

- For larger projects, more granular file structure might be better

terraform-azure-data-project/
  ├── main.tf                # High-level orchestration, define modules
  ├── azure/                 # Azure resources
  │   ├── main.tf            # Resource groups 
  ├── databricks/            # Databricks resources
      ├── main.tf

## modules

- In the root, main.tf is called the root module
- In turn, all other modules are called child modules which are called from the root module
- After chaning modules, terraform init need to be run, as terraform can adjust the changes
- root = where terraform is initialised and expected to find any configuration files


## Storage account naming convention

- One storage account per environment
- One storage acccount per project per environment -> more granular

## filesystem
- File system is a logical container for your data
- I managed to split containers based on layer and under each layer, there are project and layer specific folders

## naming conventions

- resource group per environment or per project? 
  -> if there are many projects, more reasonable could be per project and environment
- Storage account naming? 
  -> [project][env][location][abbrevition for stroage account][index]
  -> this is just one approach 
- file system naming? 
  -> This also depends on how previous layers are organised 
  -> If storage account is only for one project, it is possible to do the following: 
    <filesystem name>
      bronze
      silver
      golder
  -> But if there are many projects in the same SA, it could be
    dev<layer>
      <project><layer>


## Naming in this example
- One project per environment and resource group
- One storage account 
- file system: dev - data
- paths: sms_bronze, sms_silver, sms_gold (<project>_<layer>)
## Where to continue
1. Link databricks to root main.tf and deploy to rg
