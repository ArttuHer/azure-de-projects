## How to start a terraform project?

1. create main.tf file
  - This is the file, where you for example define resource groups and which provider you are using
  - In this case, we use azurerm to make a connection between terraform and azure API
2. login to your Azure account
  - This was done, for example, with Azure CLI
3. Add information to your main.tf file 
  - Azure provider link: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

## Useful commands
