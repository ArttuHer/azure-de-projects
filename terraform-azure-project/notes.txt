## How to start a terraform project?

1. create main.tf file
  - This is the file, where you for example define resource groups and which provider you are using
  - In this case, we use azurerm to make a connection between terraform and azure API
2. login to your Azure account
  - This was done, for example, with Azure CLI
3. Add information to your main.tf file 
  - Azure provider link: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

## Useful commands

terraform init 
  - Initialises terraform-related information
  - .terraform is not committed to versison control as it contains some metadata of how terraform runs in backend

terraform fmt
  - runs terraform format command and cleans whitespaces 
  - does not check or test your code

terraform plan
  - runs a plan based on main.tf
  - basically it checks what you have defined

terraform apply
  - this will deploy your resources to defined provider

terraform state list
  - this will show what resources we currently have

terraform state show azurerm_resource_group.mtc-rg
  - this will show information about the resource

terraform plan -destroy 
  - this will show what will be destroyed

terraform apply -destroy
  - this is the actual destroy command
  - you can restore the previous state by using the backup file

## Subnet address

address_space = ["10.123.0.0/16"]

  - This gives the IP address range for the network
  - This is the starting point: 10.123.0.0
  - /16 means prefix lenght, i.e. how many addresses there could be
